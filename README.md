# Simple Multi-Agent Learning Library (SMALL)
Welcome to the Simple Multi-Agent Learning Library or SMALL. SMALL is a programming library written in Java. SMALL aims
to be a simple, yet powerful tool for running Machine Learning experiments. SMALL provides an initial set of the basic
learning algorithms and environments which can be used from the get go and means to extend SMALL to include your own.

This document covers:

1. Quick start to running SMALL
2. Finding your way around the code
3. How to write your own learning algorithm
  * Writing the learning algorithm
  * Writing a visualisation
4. How to write your own environment
  * Writing the environment
  * Writing a visualisation
5. Miscellaneous information
